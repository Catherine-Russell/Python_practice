# This is useful because it allows us to reuse the logic in report_pay with different tax formulas without having to change report_pay at all, or do any logic outside of the functions.

# Consider putting the above in a Python file, running it, and playing around with it. Try creating a new tax calculation function for a zero-tax, or a fixed tax rate, and pass it in to report_pay.
